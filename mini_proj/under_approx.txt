			   Under approximation ideas

1. Z3 has inbuilt tactics to under approximate.

	- add-bounds
		add bounds to unbounded variables (under approximation).
	- nla2bv
		convert a nonlinear arithmetic problem into a bit-vector
	problem, in most cases the resultant goal is an under approximation
	and is useul for finding models.

	drawbacks
		- I don't have control over the variables anymore.
		- I don't know which variable is replaced by which.
	

2. Under approximate using known constants.
	
	under approximate variables with bitvector of size approximately
same as the constants it has relation with. or similarly adding bounds.
